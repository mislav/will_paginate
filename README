= WillPaginate

Pagination is just limiting the number of records displayed. Why should you let
it get in your way while developing, then? This plugin makes magic happen. Did
you ever want to be able to do just this on a model:

  Post.paginate :page => 1, :order => 'created_at DESC'

... and then render the page links with a single view helper? Well, now you
can.

Ryan Bates made an awesome screencast[http://railscasts.com/episodes/51],
check it out.

== Installation

Will Paginate officially supports Rails versions 1.2.6 and 2.0.x.

Previously, the plugin was available on the following SVN location:

  svn://errtheblog.com/svn/plugins/will_paginate

In February 2008, it moved to GitHub[http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/tree]
to be tracked with git. The SVN repo continued to have updates, but not
forever. Therefore you should switch to using the gem:

  gem install will_paginate --no-ri

After that, you can remove the plugin from your applications and add
a simple require to the end of config/environment.rb:

  require 'will_paginate'

That's it, just remember to install the gem on all machines that
you are deploying to.

The second option is to download and extract the tarball from GitHub. Here is the
link for downloading the current state of the master branch:
http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/tarball/master

Extract it to <tt>vendor/plugins</tt>. The directory will have a default name
like "mislav-will_paginate-master"; you can rename it to "will_paginate" for
simplicity.

== Example usage

Use a paginate finder in the controller:

    @posts = Post.paginate_by_board_id @board.id, :page => params[:page], :order => 'updated_at DESC'

Yeah, +paginate+ works just like +find+ -- it just doesn't fetch all the
records.  Don't forget to tell it which page you want, or it will complain!
Read more on WillPaginate::Finder::ClassMethods.

Render the posts in your view like you would normally do. When you need to render
pagination, just stick this in:

    <%= will_paginate @posts %>

You're done. (Copy and paste the example fancy CSS styles from the bottom.) You
can find the option list at WillPaginate::ViewHelpers.

How does it know how much items to fetch per page? It asks your model by calling
its <tt>per_page</tt> class method. You can define it like this:

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      cattr_reader :per_page
      @@per_page = 50
    end

... or like this:

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      def self.per_page
        50
      end
    end

... or don't worry about it at all. WillPaginate defines it to be <b>30</b> by default.
But you can always specify the count explicitly when calling +paginate+:

    @posts = Post.paginate :page => params[:page], :per_page => 50

The +paginate+ finder wraps the original finder and returns your resultset that now has
some new properties. You can use the collection as you would with any ActiveRecord
resultset. WillPaginate view helpers also need that object to be able to render pagination:

    <ol>
      <% for post in @posts -%>
        <li>Render `post` in some nice way.</li>
      <% end -%>
    </ol>

    <p>Now let's render us some pagination!</p>
    <%= will_paginate @posts %>

== Oh noes, a bug!

Tell us what happened so we can fix it, quick! Issues are filed on the Lighthouse project:
http://err.lighthouseapp.com/projects/466-plugins/tickets?q=tagged:will_paginate

Steps to make an awesome bug report:

1. Run <tt>rake test</tt> in the <i>will_paginate</i> directory. (You will need SQLite3.)
   Copy the output if there are failing tests.
2. Register on Lighthouse to create a new ticket.
3. Write a descriptive, short title. Provide as much info as you can in the body.
   Assign the ticket to Mislav and tag it with meaningful tags, <tt>"will_paginate"</tt>
   being among them.
4. Yay! You will be notified on updates automatically.

== Usable pagination in the UI

Copy the following CSS into your stylesheet for a good start:

  .pagination {
    padding: 3px;
    margin: 3px;
  }
  .pagination a {
    padding: 2px 5px 2px 5px;
    margin: 2px;
    border: 1px solid #aaaadd;
    text-decoration: none;
    color: #000099;
  }
  .pagination a:hover, .pagination a:active {
    border: 1px solid #000099;
    color: #000;
  }
  .pagination span.current {
    padding: 2px 5px 2px 5px;
    margin: 2px;
    border: 1px solid #000099;
    font-weight: bold;
    background-color: #000099;
    color: #FFF;
  }
  .pagination span.disabled {
    padding: 2px 5px 2px 5px;
    margin: 2px;
    border: 1px solid #eee;
    color: #ddd;
  }
